For me, it is about the examples. I would suggest adding some better 
doco around passing items by reference and arrays. I admit I am weak at 
C, so making the jump between a char*** and an array of strings was not 
intuitive. The JNA website [1]  gives in doco examples to explain the 
harder concepts. I see some of this in [2] but it could be beefed up.
