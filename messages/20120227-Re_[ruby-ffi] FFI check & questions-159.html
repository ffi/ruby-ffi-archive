On line 40 of the ruby file the required memory is apparently 4Gb, <br>&gt;&gt; this is<br>&gt;&gt; obviously wrong, does anyone know why? (I assume I have messed <br>&gt;&gt; something up<br>&gt;&gt; somewhere)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Perhaps setting the output type to 0 is wrong. I'm not sure what <br>&gt; output type would demand 4GB, though.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Can anyone see any other obvious mistakes on my part?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I'm guessing allocating 4GB is not going very well. Do check the that <br>&gt; the resulting pointer isn't null, i.e., with picBuf.null?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regards,<br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote>
