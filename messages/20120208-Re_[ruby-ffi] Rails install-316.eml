turn gem has nothing to do with ffi (Ruby-FFI) project or gem, so you
posting here seems unrelated.

Turn does exist in rubygems.org:

http://rubygems.org/gems/turn

So perhaps you're having internet connection issues when you did
"bundle install"

I think the message is pretty clear, you need to run "bundle install"

json gem has nothing to do with Ruby-FFI project.

I believe I did mention this all over the place in your threads at
RailsInstaller group: please include exact output you get at the
console.
