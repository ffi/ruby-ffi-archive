Hello,

I'm going to have to jump into this discussion as well. While I can't
get any hard statistic, I think I'm one of the largest users of FFI,
with the development of Vagrant, virtualbox bindings, and libvirt
bindings. All the aforementioned projects are used in "enterprisey"
environments, where the only company-bestowed Ruby installation is
that which their current OS ships with its package manager.

For Ubuntu users, this means that my corporate users are restricted to
Ruby 1.8.7 for another year at least (until another LTS release is
out). To support this, I've had to restrict FFI versions for my gems
to "~> 0.6.3" I'm even currently struggling with a company interested
in using my libvirt bindings, but they're restricting to Ruby 1.8.5!
(RedHat Enterprise Linux 5) While I think thats a bit too far back, I
think you get the idea.

While I agree that Ruby 1.9.x adoption is improving and moving
forward, there are important groups of people who simply _cant_ move
forward, even if they wanted to, due to corporate policy.

FFI is an important enough library for Ruby that this needs to be
handled in a cleaner way.

I'd love to help in any way I can. I've never written a C extension so
my experience falls short there, but if I can provide testing (Vagrant/
virtualbox _really_ stress FFI) or some other form of support, I'm
happy to.

Thanks for all your hard work so far.

Best,
Mitchell
