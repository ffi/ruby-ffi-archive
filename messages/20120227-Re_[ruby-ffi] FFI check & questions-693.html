    Hello all<br>
    <br>
    I was adding some error checking (Checking page numbers etc) to make
    sure that the pdf data was being read correctly and tried converting
    a different PDF (one with more pages) and it worked!<br>
    <br>
    So it looks like there may be some issues depending on the PDF data
    but I imagine this is internal to the library.<br>
    <br>
    In other words, it works! <br>
    <br>
    Thank you very much for the help all. <br>

      Hello Wayne,<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for the information and advice, it was very
      englightening.<br>
      <br>
      1) I double checked and get_pagememsize does in fact return a
      size_it, not an int. I copied the method signatures from the
      documentation but the documentation is incorrect. The header file
      definition is: size_t pdf2img_get_pagememsize(ImageConversion iC)<br>
      <br>
      I have checked the others again and they appear to be correct.<br>
      <br>
      2) Thank you for that, I had no idea that this was incorrect.
      Unless there is any objections I would like to add an explicit
      section on that to the wiki.<br>
      <br>
      I have updated the gist with the latest code.<br>
      <br>
      I am still getting 4095MB returned from get_pagememsize function
      however, but from what I can see none of the ruby code could
      affect that since passing in bad data from ruby earlier would
      raise an exception before getting to the pagememsize function.<br>
      <br>
      regards<br>

        There are a couple of problems:
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>1) The return type of get_pagememsize should be :int, not
          :size_t - :size_t is 64bit on 64bit platforms, and it will
          return bogus values from a function that actually returns an
          int.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>2) You're using string ops on binary data.  In FFI,
          anything that is :string, or read_string or write_string
          treats the string as a NUL terminated C string - i.e. it will
          stop reading at the first zero byte, and ensures the data
          written to memory is terminated with a zero byte.</div>

            using FFI but have run <br>
            &gt;&gt; into a few<br>
            &gt;&gt; issues mainly due to my lack of FFI experience and
            general lack of C++.<br>

            &gt;&gt; The following Gist has the example C++ code (Posted
            with permission) <br>
            &gt;&gt; and my Ruby<br>
            &gt;&gt; code along side some example output. <a

            &gt;&gt; On line 22 of the ruby file I have defined the
            second argument as an <br>
            &gt;&gt; :int, this<br>
            &gt;&gt; is probably wrong but it suffices for the moment I
            think. I assume <br>
            &gt;&gt; the real<br>
            &gt;&gt; value is an Enumeration, struct or something along
            those lines. It is <br>
            &gt;&gt; not<br>
            &gt;&gt; documented so I will ask the original developers.<br>
            &gt;<br>
            &gt; You should take a look at the file 'pdf2imglib.h', to
            see what the <br>
            &gt; values of that enumeration are. In particular, what
            integer value <br>
            &gt; corresponds to GIFoutput.<br>
            &gt;<br>
            &gt;&gt; Questions:<br>
            &gt;&gt;<br>
            &gt;&gt; 1. On line 40 of the ruby file the required memory
            is apparently 4Gb, <br>
            &gt;&gt; this is<br>
            &gt;&gt; obviously wrong, does anyone know why? (I assume I
            have messed <br>
            &gt;&gt; something up<br>
            &gt;&gt; somewhere)<br>
            &gt;<br>
            &gt; Perhaps setting the output type to 0 is wrong. I'm not
            sure what <br>
            &gt; output type would demand 4GB, though.<br>
            &gt;<br>
            &gt;&gt; 2. Can anyone see any other obvious mistakes on my
            part?<br>
            &gt;<br>
            &gt; I'm guessing allocating 4GB is not going very well. Do
            check the that <br>
            &gt; the resulting pointer isn't null, i.e., with
            picBuf.null?<br>
            &gt;<br>
