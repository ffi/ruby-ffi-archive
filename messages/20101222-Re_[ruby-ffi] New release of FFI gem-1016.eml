I think that this should be simply ignored on 1.8. These is very good =
precedent for doing so: CAPI methods. Users regularly write methods in C =
that perform some long action which blocks all threads. Thus users are =
used to this very thing for a long time and are generally ok with it.

If a FFI method blocks the same as a C-API method, then FFI doesn't have =
a bug.

Again, I think we can safely ignore this functionality on 1.8 and simply =
report an error if a user attempts it (which can be detected using the =
global variable techinque). My reasoning is the same as above, namely =
that you can't write a C-API method that does this, so there is no need =
for FFI to support it.
