<br>variants).
<br>
<br>FFI::AutoPointer also has the advantage on JRuby of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> using
<br>ObjectSpace, so a) it will actually work in jruby-1.5.0 and later
<br>where objectspace is not on by default, and b) is less overhead, since
<br>its implemented via standard java PhantomReferences.
<br>
<br>Use it something like this:
<br>
<br>class VectorPointer&lt;&nbsp; FFI::AutoPointer
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; def self.release(ptr)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # ptr is the original pointer you passed in to create VectorPointer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GSLng.backend.gsl_free_vector(ptr)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<br>end
<br>
<br>Then use it like thus:
<br>&nbsp; ptr = VectorPointer.new(GSLng.backend.gsl_alloc_vector(n))
<br>
<br>It is a FFI::Pointer subclass, so you can pass it wherever a :pointer
<br>parameter is needed, or use it in a Struct :pointer field, etc.
<br>
<br>There is also AutoPointer#free() to free the memory earlier than the
<br>GC cleanup (which is a good idea when you can use it), #autorelease=()
<br>to toggle on/off the auto cleanup.

<br><blockquote type=cite style="color: #000000;">Hi,
<br>I'm in the process of developing a Ruby binding to the GSL numerical
<br>library using FFI. Recently I stumbled upon a problematic issue
<br>regarding memory management and finalizers.
<br>
<br>Since the GSL library allows creation and destruction of instances
<br>like this:
<br>gsl_vector* ptr = gsl_alloc_vector(size_t n);
<br>...
<br>gsl_free_vector(ptr);
<br>
<br>Then, in Ruby I do something like this:
<br>
<br>class Vector
<br>&nbsp; def initialize(n)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @ptr = GSLng.backend.gsl_alloc_vector(n)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vector.define_finalizer(self, @ptr)
<br>&nbsp; end
<br>
<br>&nbsp; def Vector.define_finalizer(self, ptr)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ObjectSpace.define_finalizer(self, lambda {<code class="moz-txt-verticalline"><span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span>id<span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span></code>
<br>GSLng.backend.gsl_free_vector(ptr)})
<br>&nbsp; end
<br>end
<br>
<br>The problem is that if later I instatiante a Vector inside a loop,
<br>like:
<br>10000.times do
<br>&nbsp; Vector.new(3)
<br>end
<br>
<br>This obviously eats a lot of memory until GC runs. Now, if I do:
<br>10000.times do
<br>&nbsp; Vector.new(3)
<br>&nbsp; GC.start
<br>end
<br>
<br>the memory that the Vector instances themselves occupy is freed but
<br>the finalizer is not called (it is later called at program end),
<br>therefore all of the memory allocated through gsl_alloc_vector() is
<br>sitting there until program ends.
<br>
<br>I know that Ruby doesn't guarantee that finalizers are called in any
<br>particular moment (even after GC.start, which I thought would
<br>suffice). So what I'm asking probably is not really related to FFI
<br>itself, but I wanted to ask here since I imagined this would be a
<br>common pattern among FFI users. The question is then: is there a
<br>better way to manage this type of memory? I obviously cant use the
<br>transaction-like pattern (like File.open) since for a Vector that
<br>wouldn't make sense. It would be ideal to make the gsl_vector_free
<br>call when the actual Vector class is free'd. Maybe I need to go to a
<br>lower level for this and use the C api to register this call in the
<br>"free" function for this class, but that would be overkill since I
<br>wanted to avoid using C altogether.
<br>
<br>Thank you!
