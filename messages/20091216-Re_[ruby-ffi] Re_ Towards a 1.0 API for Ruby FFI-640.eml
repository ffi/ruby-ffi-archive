Fully agree. My intention was not to mean that FFI.add_sys_types would =
begin parsing header files right then figure out the results. Only that =
the by hiding it behind a method, every implementation is free to make =
the best decision about how they want to import them.

I'd imagine that typically, ruby-ffi would calculate these values at =
build time and put them in either a .rb file that you include, or =
perhaps the FFI.add_sys_types method would be a C method that adds the =
types, thereby using the compiler itself to do most of the work.

Again, the method is a simple abstraction to allow each implementation =
the most flexibility with the least pain.
