This was answered previously in the group, asked by Roger and answered
by Wayne about it.

This was answered too.

Me too, but I believe that posts should be scanned.

Both questions from Roger were asked by him before, both got answers
from Wayne (ffi_lib) and Jon and myself for FindWindow call under
Windows.

If he is going to ask again those, ignoring the previous comments
generated by us on that subject, I consider that either our answers
weren't clear or he didn't pay attention to the time we invested in
answering.

Indeed, is not clear the usage from the documentation due the lack of
one example.

As for accumulative calls, I'm not fond to them since I don't see the purpo=
se.

If Roger stated better his questions and sample for us to comprehend I
would have answered differently.
