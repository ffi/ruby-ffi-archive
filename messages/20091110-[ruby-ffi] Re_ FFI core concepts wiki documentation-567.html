<br>One of the areas in which the current wiki documentation could be improved is the Core Concepts category.
<br>
<br>By this I mean, there's usually 3 - 5 key things about most things that you really need to have a good handle on in order to quickly become productive.&nbsp; Not that these cover every possible case, but they get you on the right path.&nbsp; FFI is likely similar.
<br>
<br>I think it's important to keep things at a higher level but ensure the documentation is not so generic as to be useless.&nbsp; I also don't see value in re-documenting stuff like Pointers 101; there's plenty of other good sites within Google reach.
<br>
<br>I plan on fleshing out <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://wiki.github.com/ffi/ffi/core-concepts">http://wiki.github.com/ffi/ffi/core-concepts</a> and would like to hear from those of you who have been working with FFI for awhile.&nbsp; The goal is to boil things down to the essence so that the page is as short and useful as it can be.
<br>
<br>* What are the things you know now that you wish would have been in a Core Concepts page when you started?
<br>* What were your top 3 "ah ha" discoveries you've made along the way?
<br>* What other sites have provided good background info that have helped your FFI implementations?
<br>* What are you top 3 gotchas/surprises when using FFI?

<br></blockquote>For me, it is about the examples. I would suggest adding some better 
doco around passing items by reference and arrays. I admit I am weak at 
C, so making the jump between a char*** and an array of strings was not 
intuitive. The JNA website [1]&nbsp; gives in doco examples to explain the 
harder concepts. I see some of this in [2] but it could be beefed up.
