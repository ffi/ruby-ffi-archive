Well that's weird.  Now it's all working in MRI.  I'm not sure which
of my changes helped, or if I sleep-walked last night after one of my
lobes declared a coup.

Here's what I did with CurlFFI:

https://github.com/aitrus/curl_ffi/commit/3e72173c9f60238f855c6e23f54e553ad=
7da3608

And here's what I did in StreamlyFFI:

https://github.com/aitrus/streamly_ffi/commit/48568e7792cd7bc8a300d0fac9923=
8799364c374

I need to go back and remove my frantic use of ".dup" and see what the
effect is.  I should probably walk back my changes to see where it
went right.
