Hi Matjis,

I could have sworn I already checked the header file for a definition 
but I obviously missed something

The code is

typedef enum {
     EPSoutput,
     TIFFoutput,
     JPEGoutput,
     BMPoutput,
     PNGoutput,
     RAWoutput,
     PDFoutput,
     GIFoutput,
} OutputTypeCode;

So 0 would be EPS output I assume, I changed it to 2 (JPEG) out of 
curiosity but the allocation is still 4Gb.

Regarding checking if picBuf is null. I added a check immediately after 
the malloc and the pointer is indeed null.
If I cheat badly and malloc image_size / 1024 then the picBuf pointer is 
not null but them of course the
get_pagemem method fails.

I have no idea why I am getting a return value of 4Gb from the 
get_pagememsize(iC) method. I was hoping there
was some obvious mistake (type conversion or something) I was making but 
if nothing obvious springs out to
more experienced eyes then I am not sure.

Regards,

Jeff
