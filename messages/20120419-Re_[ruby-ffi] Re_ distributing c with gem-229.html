<br>&gt; &nbsp;I've tried to crack this one as well. After learning that RubyGems will build extensions using configure-make-install in addition to extconf.rb, I have a branch of ruby-llvm that uses the autotools to build and manage a shared library, but unfortunately haven't released it yet because of incompatibilities between autoconf versions on Mac and Ubuntu.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; You can see my approach athttps://<a href="http://github.com/jvoorhis/ruby-llvm/tree/support-lib" target="_blank">github.com/jvoorhis/<wbr>ruby-llvm/tree/support-lib</a>. If anyone is an autotools pro, or has a better idea, please help! :)
