Depends on what the "weird" behaviour is.  The other half of the
threading equation, is calling native functions which block (i.e.
sleep, wait for I/O, take a long time to complete, whatever).

In JRuby, its not a problem, since it has real threads and no GIL, but
for MRI (once again, 1.9 only, ffi from master), you can add the
@blocking attribute when you attach your functions, like so:

  @blocking =3D true
  attach_function :zmq_whatever, [ ... ], :rtype

That is a hint to FFI that the function could block, and it should
release the GIL before calling it.  Thats a bit of a performance hit,
which is why its functions are not assumed to be blocking by default.
