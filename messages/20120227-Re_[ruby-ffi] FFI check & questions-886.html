    Hello Wayne,<br>
    <br>
    Thank you for the information and advice, it was very englightening.<br>
    <br>
    1) I double checked and get_pagememsize does in fact return a
    size_it, not an int. I copied the method signatures from the
    documentation but the documentation is incorrect. The header file
    definition is: size_t pdf2img_get_pagememsize(<wbr>ImageConversion iC)<br>
    <br>
    I have checked the others again and they appear to be correct.<br>
    <br>
    2) Thank you for that, I had no idea that this was incorrect. Unless
    there is any objections I would like to add an explicit section on
    that to the wiki.<br>
    <br>
    I have updated the gist with the latest code.<br>
    <br>
    I am still getting 4095MB returned from get_pagememsize function
    however, but from what I can see none of the ruby code could affect
    that since passing in bad data from ruby earlier would raise an
    exception before getting to the pagememsize function.<br>
    <br>
    regards<br>
    <br>

      There are a couple of problems:
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>1) The return type of get_pagememsize should be :int, not
        :size_t - :size_t is 64bit on 64bit platforms, and it will
        return bogus values from a function that actually returns an
        int.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>2) You're using string ops on binary data. &nbsp;In FFI, anything
        that is :string, or read_string or write_string treats the
        string as a NUL terminated C string - i.e. it will stop reading
        at the first zero byte, and ensures the data written to memory
        is terminated with a zero byte.</div>

          &gt;&gt; Questions:<br>
          &gt;&gt;<br>
          &gt;&gt; 1. On line 40 of the ruby file the required memory is
          apparently 4Gb, <br>
          &gt;&gt; this is<br>
          &gt;&gt; obviously wrong, does anyone know why? (I assume I
          have messed <br>
          &gt;&gt; something up<br>
          &gt;&gt; somewhere)<br>
          &gt;<br>
          &gt; Perhaps setting the output type to 0 is wrong. I'm not
          sure what <br>
          &gt; output type would demand 4GB, though.<br>
          &gt;<br>
          &gt;&gt; 2. Can anyone see any other obvious mistakes on my
          part?<br>
          &gt;<br>
          &gt; I'm guessing allocating 4GB is not going very well. Do
          check the that <br>
          &gt; the resulting pointer isn't null, i.e., with picBuf.null?<br>
          &gt;<br>
