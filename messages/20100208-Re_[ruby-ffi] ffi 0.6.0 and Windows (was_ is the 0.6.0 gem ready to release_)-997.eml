The only issue was that I ran out of time yesterday morning to sort
out the windows builds (my macports is busted somewhere), but I wanted
to release the 0.6.0 gem for linux/MacOS, because there are bugs
piling up about ruby-ffi not building correctly on those platforms.

And I figured that it would still work with the devkit on windows.  I
forgot to factor in the upgrade to libffi-3.0.9 breaking something.

I've added you to the ffi repo as a collaborator, so take a stab at it
if you want.  Vladimir Sizikov might also be interested (he did the
win32 & win64 work for jffi, so he has experience there).

Before you do, check out the latest libffi from
http://github.com/atgreen/libffi - it appears there has been work on
msvc compilation there - all after the libffi-3.0.9 release, so it
isn't in ruby-ffi, but it might be worth updating to it.
