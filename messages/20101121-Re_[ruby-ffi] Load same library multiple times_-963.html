<div class="moz-text-html"  lang="x-western">The application I&#39;m using this for is simulating a small system (embedded CPU) which just happens to be in C.  The nodes are connected together with radios (think Crossbow or Dust Systems), and I&#39;d like to simulate a network of them, while letting the Ruby code record the radio traffic to a database for later analysis.  When they make a call to their &quot;Send a radio message&quot; routine, I just catch that in the Ruby and then deliver it to whatever nodes are &quot;close enough&quot; to hear it.  I think I can make it work using the FFI and call-backs.  I&#39;ve found that I can use the library approach if I make a discrete copy of the library for each node; each will get mapped into the space independently.  The global variables don&#39;t clash because all the linking is done at runtime; I&#39;m not sure exactly how it works, but it appears that the global vars are not added to the processes global vars, at least as far as I can tell.<div>

&gt; I&#39;d like to load the same library multiple times, so that the global<br>

&gt; objects are all communicating with each other, and I&#39;d like to track<br>
&gt; the communication.  I&#39;ve posted a simple example in the issues at<br>

</div></div>I don&#39;t think this is possible. When you load a library, it is mapped into the same address space as the interpreter (MRI, JRuby, Rubinius, etc.). If your library is using global variables in a global namespace, then it isn&#39;t re-entrant either.<br>

<br>
I recommend modifying the library so it is re-entrant. Then you can load the library *once* but call into it from multiple threads safely.<br>
