Yes, I think libffi is the only bit now that doesn't work with spaces.

There are a couple of alternatives:
1) Install libffi via macports or brew - ruby-ffi should detect these when=
=20
installing
2) I don't think there is anything in ruby-ffi that requires the latest=20
libffi anymore ... its possible that it would work just fine with the=20
ancient libffi that macosx ships with.
