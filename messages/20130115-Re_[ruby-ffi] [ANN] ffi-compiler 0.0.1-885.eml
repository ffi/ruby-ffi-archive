Don't underestimate the power of late night hacking ;-)

I was wondering since I started to work on a rake-compiler replacement
that works outside-in called gem-compiler:

https://github.com/luislavena/gem-compiler

But it collects compiled artifacts from known locations defined in the
gemspec like require_paths:

https://github.com/luislavena/gem-compiler/blob/master/lib/rubygems/compile=
r.rb#L26-L28

That is why I peek into the final placement of the compiled shared object.

Couldn't agree more :)

I think pre-compiled gems generated with ffi-compiler could be
processed with gem-compiler too, to provide pre-compiled binaries for
some platforms where gem compilation might be difficult.

Not just talking about Windows, also pre-compiled for other platforms.

Again, will take a look on Windows later today and chime in, hope you
don't mind :)
