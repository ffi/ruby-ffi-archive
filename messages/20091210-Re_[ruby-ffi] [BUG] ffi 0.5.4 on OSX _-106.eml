Ok, I think this one is fixed.

I tested in 3 modes.

1) no macports in PATH.  Uses /usr/bin/ruby and compiles libffi from
source, because /usr/lib/libffi is dodgy.

2) macports in PATH, using /usr/bin/ruby.  Links against macports
libffi, found via macports pkg-config

3) macports in PATH, using macports ruby.  Links against macports libffi.

Jeremy, can you update to ffi master and test it on your setup?
