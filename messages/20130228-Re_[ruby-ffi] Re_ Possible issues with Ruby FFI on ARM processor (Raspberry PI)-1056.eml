Updated the rest of the MemoryPointers (as far as I am aware). The ruby exa=
mple still appears to segfault. =20

I converted the C example to use malloc()-allocated memory, and freeing it =
aggressively after it=92s purpose
has been fulfilled, and I=92m happy to say that the C example now also segf=
ault with similar errors (randomly).
I also removed the calls to free (no time to upload), and it appears the li=
brary still segfault.

 From what I can gather from this, it appears the library has some issues wi=
th malloc()-memory, only on the
ARM platform. That is interesting. I=92ll have to experiment some this even=
ing to see if I can figure out exactly
which part of it is, and probably file a bug report with the library author=
s.

Thanks Wayne; the problem existing because of stack/heap memory was not som=
ething that could have
occurred to me.
