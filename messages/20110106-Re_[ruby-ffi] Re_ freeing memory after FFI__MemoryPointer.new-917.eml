I recommend running your code under rubinius and using its heap dump to see where you are holding on to Ruby object references. Make sure you install at least version 1.2.0 (or master) and run "rbx docs" which will bring up a browser window (on OSX) with the latest documentation. Take a look at section 13 (Tools) and read through the memory analysis item.

I recommend taking a snapshot of your program after it has had 20 seconds or so to "warm up" and then do a second heap dump after the memory leak is obvious. Follow the documentation to get details on your object counts. Hopefully that will point you to the code that is holding onto references and causing your "leak."
