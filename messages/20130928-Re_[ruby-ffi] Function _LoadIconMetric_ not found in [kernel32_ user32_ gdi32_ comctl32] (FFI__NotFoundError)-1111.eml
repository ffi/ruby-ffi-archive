Have you hacked up an ugly absolute path prototype similar to

module Win
  extend FFI::Library

  ffi_lib
'C:/Windows/WinSxS/x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.9200.20683_none_726bd1009fad308c/comctl32.dll'
  ffi_convention :stdcall
  ...
end

to see if `attach_function` binds to LoadIconMetric@380, and the rest of
your code works?

These SxS dirs appear regularly named so `ENV["WINDIR"]` plus other
cleverness (e.g- parse the MSFT XML or create a simpler, custom manifest)
could get rid of hard coded ugliness.

IMO, attempting to support MSFT manifests in ffi would add too much
complexity.
