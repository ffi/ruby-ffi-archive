<div class="moz-text-flowed" style="font-family: -moz-fixed; font-size: 12px;" lang="x-unicode">Hi Matjis,
<br>
<br>I could have sworn I already checked the header file for a definition 
but I obviously missed something
<br>
<br>The code is
<br>
<br>typedef enum {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EPSoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TIFFoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JPEGoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BMPoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PNGoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RAWoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PDFoutput,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIFoutput,
<br>} OutputTypeCode;
<br>
<br>So 0 would be EPS output I assume, I changed it to 2 (JPEG) out of 
curiosity but the allocation is still 4Gb.
<br>
<br>Regarding checking if picBuf is null. I added a check immediately after 
the malloc and the pointer is indeed null.
<br>If I cheat badly and malloc image_size / 1024 then the picBuf pointer is 
not null but them of course the
<br>get_pagemem method fails.
<br>
<br>I have no idea why I am getting a return value of 4Gb from the 
get_pagememsize(iC) method. I was hoping there
<br>was some obvious mistake (type conversion or something) I was making but 
if nothing obvious springs out to
<br>more experienced eyes then I am not sure.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>
<br>Jeff

<br>You should take a look at the file 'pdf2imglib.h', to see what the 
values of that enumeration are. In particular, what integer value 
corresponds to GIFoutput.

<br>1. On line 40 of the ruby file the required memory is apparently 4Gb,

<br>Perhaps setting the output type to 0 is wrong. I'm not sure what 
output type would demand 4GB, though.

<br>I'm guessing allocating 4GB is not going very well. Do check the that 
the resulting pointer isn't null, i.e., with picBuf.null?
