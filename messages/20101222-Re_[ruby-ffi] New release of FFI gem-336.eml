I agree. Sorry that I didn't chime in when 1.0.0 was released also, I =
got tied up with the Rubinius 1.2 release.

I agree this, is a tricky problem that Wayne has done a great job =
supporting. But I think that the difficulty in it points that it's just =
not possible to do properly with the architecture of 1.8. Not supporting =
callbacks on non-ruby threads seems like an OK compromise. Are there a =
lot of people using this functionality?

Wayne, in the past we've talked about me help with the gem development =
and API. I'm happy to start doing this in earnest.
