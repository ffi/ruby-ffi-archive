Can you build ffi from github and retry it on 1.9?  I added special
support for callbacks from non-ruby threads (only works on 1.9 though
- 1.8 is completely screwed in that situation).

JRuby has no problem, because upcalls from C -> java always check &
attach a JVM context, and jruby automagically adopts threads it does
not know about.
