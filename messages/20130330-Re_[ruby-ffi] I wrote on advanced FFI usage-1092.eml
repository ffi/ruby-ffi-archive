Hehe, yes. I wanted to see if I could run some MRI-working code (spotify ge=
m + OpenAL) on JRuby,
and in doing that I ran into a few issues. The reason for doing that was be=
cause I became curious as

I was writing the article. I=92m happy to say I managed to get it running o=
n JRuby, streaming music from
the spotify API, bound with FFI, into the OpenAL API, bound with FFI. Reall=
y cool!
> postmodern: all of the other blog posts only cover loading a library and =
attaching some functions.
Yes. I have not yet found a blog post that explains the basics better than =
the wiki though. The wiki is
a nice collection of information, and it was pretty much my bible when I st=
arted with FFI, together with


the FFI source code. I believe there is place for yet another article on FF=
I, aimed at people beginning
with FFI for the first time.

subclass.

This is a really nice way of using FFI, and I actually do this throughout a=
ll one of my FFI gems. The
spotify library in particular uses a reference counting mechanism, where so=
me functions return pointers
that should have their reference increased, and I do that automatically wit=
h a similar mechanic to .auto_ptr:
https://github.com/Burgestrand/spotify/blob/a7deb7b4e9334c95f6c3a2d8f077264=
dc7d55f8d/lib/spotify/managed_pointer.rb#L76

> 4) Completely replace the FFI api with your own concoction.  Using FFI::D=
ynamicLibrary, FFI::Function, and FFI::DataConverter, you can write your ow=
n API for mapping C libraries into ruby.  Thats how JRuby implements legacy=
 interfaces like dl and Win32API.

I did not know you could do that. Nice!
