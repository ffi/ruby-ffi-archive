<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>That's a really good question - "when you're unhappy with FFI+ffi-compiler" would be the pithy answer. &nbsp;FFI isn't going away, so if people are happy with it, then I encourage them to keep using it. &nbsp;At this point, FFI is stable and works. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you're writing a gem from scratch, and you're going to end up writing a bunch of ruby boilerplate around a raw FFI api, and you'll need to use ffi-compiler to compile some native shims, then XNI might be worth a look. &nbsp;At least once it is a bit more stable.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0;margin-left: 0.8ex;border-left: 1px #ccc solid;padding-left: 1ex;">&nbsp; * will XNI always utilize FFI?
<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>It will always utilize a ffi-like way of interfacing between the ruby VM and the native code (that is part of the design), but it won't always use the FFI gem. &nbsp;There is a native backend for JRuby-1.7+, and I am currently working on a native CRuby backend. &nbsp;There could also be a native backend for Topaz that uses ctypes (or whatever the RPython equivalent is).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0;margin-left: 0.8ex;border-left: 1px #ccc solid;padding-left: 1ex;">
