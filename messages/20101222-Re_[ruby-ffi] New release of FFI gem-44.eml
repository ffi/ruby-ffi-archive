> Wayne: Can you summarize what's needed to get 1.8.7 support back in the gem?

It should (ffi master) build and install on 1.8.x.  The main reason I
dropped support for everything but 1.9.2+ on MacOS, was to reduce the
surface area of the things I had to support, to actually get a new
release out the door.

I figured that anyone who cared about the other versions+platforms
that broke would help to fix them.  This happened with win32 support
(thanks to Luis & Jon), which is why it got fixed almost immediately
... but its only been this week that people have started to make noise
about 1.8.x not working.

There are a couple of different problems in 1.8.x

1) Blocking calls.  These are C functions which will wait (e.g. on
I/O).  Calling one of these will lock up the interpreter until the
function returns.  The only way I've found to fix this for 1.8 is to:
  a) create a pipe
  b) spin up a new native thread, pass it the converted native
arguments and the write end of the pipe
  c) have the ruby thread go to sleep until the pipe becomes readable
via rb_thread_wait_fd()
  d) once the native thread returns from the function call, write to the pipe
  e) ruby thread wakes up from rb_thread_wait_fd(), closes the pipe,
joins on the native thread

Not exactly rocket surgery, but not trivial either - and there will
need to be two implementations, one for pthreads, one for win32
(assuming we can't get just settle for 1.9.2+ on win32).

2) Callbacks from non-ruby threads.  This is possibly more
complicated, and there does not appear (unless I missed it) a way in
1.8.x to detect attempts to call into the interpreter from a non-ruby
thread.  This manifests as non-obvious crashes, that look to be in
completely different sections of code.

  I think there is a simple way to detect non-ruby threads calling
back, just by storing/clearing the current thread id in a global var
when entering/exiting native code, and checking that from the callback
code.  This would mean the callback just does not get called when
called from a non-ruby thread (and possibly an error is logged).

  Fixing it properly so callbacks from non-ruby threads actually work,
will be something similar to what is done for 1.9.x, but with the
twist of using a pipe instead of a mutex+condvar.
