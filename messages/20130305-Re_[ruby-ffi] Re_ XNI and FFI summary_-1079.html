&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; When you get a free moment, please provide a quick summary of: 
<br>&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; &gt; &nbsp; * XNI's main reason(s) for being 
<br>&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; At the moment, its an experiment in native interface design. &nbsp;The aim is a 
<br>&gt; stream-lined FFI+ffi-compiler combo, with some hard-coded conventions to 
<br>&gt; make it easier to implement common patterns when writing extensions, whilst 
<br>&gt; avoiding the "gigantic-ball-of-mud" that is the ruby C api. &nbsp;But, XNI does 
<br>&gt; not try to do everything - since you don't get access to Ruby VM internals, 
<br>&gt; you wouldn't use it for e.g. implementing a new data structure.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; This is Jeremy's hitimes gem converted to use FFI+ffi-compiler:
<br>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/wmeissner/hitimes/commit/b226af0498127a9e25f002b01db9230f68f93f7b" target="_blank">https://github.com/wmeissner/<u></u>h<wbr>itimes/commit/<u></u>b226af0498127a9e<wbr>25f002b01db923<u></u>0f68f93f7b</a>
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; and converted to use XNI:
<br>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/wmeissner/hitimes/commit/9252959cebc6678a969ba672438ba4b11ff98ef5" target="_blank">https://github.com/wmeissner/<u></u>h<wbr>itimes/commit/<u></u>9252959cebc6678a<wbr>969ba672438ba4<u></u>b11ff98ef5</a>
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; The XNI one has a bit less ruby boilerplate (XNI has the concept of a 
<br>&gt; DataObject, which can have instance methods that automagically pass in 
<br>&gt; 'self' to native methods). &nbsp;On the other hand, XNI excises a few FFI 
<br>&gt; concepts - there is no Struct that you can wrap around existing native 
<br>&gt; memory, nor MemoryPointer for generic native memory allocations.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; (as to why I used hitimes - its a fairly nicely written cext, it doesn't do 
<br>&gt; anything super-complicated, but would be hard to implement in pure FFI due 
<br>&gt; to the data structures and API calls it needs).
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; &nbsp; * when should one prefer XNI over FFI? 
<br>&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; That's a really good question - "when you're unhappy with FFI+ffi-compiler" 
<br>&gt; would be the pithy answer. &nbsp;FFI isn't going away, so if people are happy 
<br>&gt; with it, then I encourage them to keep using it. &nbsp;At this point, FFI is 
<br>&gt; stable and works. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you're writing a gem from scratch, 
<br>&gt; and you're going to end up writing a bunch of ruby boilerplate around a raw 
<br>&gt; FFI api, and you'll need to use ffi-compiler to compile some native shims, 
<br>&gt; then XNI might be worth a look. &nbsp;At least once it is a bit more stable.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; &nbsp; * will XNI always utilize FFI? 
<br>&gt; &gt;
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; It will always utilize a ffi-like way of interfacing between the ruby VM 
<br>&gt; and the native code (that is part of the design), but it won't always use 
<br>&gt; the FFI gem. &nbsp;There is a native backend for JRuby-1.7+, and I am currently 
<br>&gt; working on a native CRuby backend. &nbsp;There could also be a native backend 
<br>&gt; for Topaz that uses ctypes (or whatever the RPython equivalent is).
<br>
<br>Thanks. It sounds intruiging and I'm looking forward to digging into XNI and ffi-compiler.
<br>
<br>Awhile ago I'd looked into go's interop, python's cffi+libffi+pycparser+ply, luajit's ffi, and powershell's ability to intfc to Win32 via .NET's interop magic. While I liked the idea of copy-n-pasting normal C declarations as in the luajit and cffi simple examples
<br>
<br>&nbsp; # luajit
<br>&nbsp; local ffi = require("ffi")
<br>&nbsp; ffi.cdef[[
<br>&nbsp; int printf(const char *fmt, ...);
<br>&nbsp; ]]
<br>
<br>&nbsp; # python cffi
<br>&nbsp; from cffi import FFI
<br>&nbsp; ffi = FFI()
<br>&nbsp; ffi.cdef("""
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int printf(const char *fmt, ...);
<br>&nbsp; """)
<br>
<br>I had a gut feeling that the extra complexity of implementing/maintaining C declaration parsing code may not be worth it. Given the types of setup questions on this list, and the setup info on the FFI wiki pages, what's your XNI perspective?
