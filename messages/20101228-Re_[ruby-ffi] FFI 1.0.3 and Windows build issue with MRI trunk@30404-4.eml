I think it's fine to enforce code consistency for MRI core and it's include=
d extensions, but agree with you on breaking third party code. I can't yet =
see how this mod enhances code quality. Extension API's already exist for t=
hird parties to code to. IMO, a build flag is not an API.

It will be interesting to see how many support issues start popping up as t=
his mod affects mainstream *nix-based builds. I also wonder if/how http://r=
ice.rubyforge.org/ users will impacted.  At least the mod's on trunk rather=
 than a release branch :)

How would you feel about having "pre-install" and "post-install" build envi=
ronments in which things like -Werror=3Ddeclaration-after-statement only li=
ve in pre-install (building ruby proper) but are filtered out of RbConfig::=
CONFIG used by extensions?=20

Time permitting, I'd like to mock up something for core's review that uses =
a new $errorflags var that is injected into $warnflags in ruby's Makefile, =
but is filtered out when generating lib/ruby/1.9.1/$(arch)/rbconfig.rb so t=
hat extensions have a less strict RbConfig::CONFIG['warnflags']. It would g=
ive more flexibility to tighten up core code checks using gcc's available f=
eatures while being more precise in constraining third party code. Good or =
bad idea from your PoV?
