Actually I was refering to the case where one needs to do a couple of
heavy independent tasks, which could benefit from parallel execution.
Specfically I was thinking in a 3d simulator I have written that uses
physics + graphics + logics (the first two in C++, the later in Ruby),
and I think some tasks could be executed in parallel there.

Anyway, for the type of problems you mention (something like a big
problem that can be solved with divide & conquer) mpi-ruby seems
interesting and its good to know it exists.
