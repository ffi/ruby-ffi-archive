Thanks. It sounds intruiging and I'm looking forward to digging into XNI an=
d ffi-compiler.

Awhile ago I'd looked into go's interop, python's cffi+libffi+pycparser+ply=
, luajit's ffi, and powershell's ability to intfc to Win32 via .NET's inter=
op magic. While I liked the idea of copy-n-pasting normal C declarations as=
 in the luajit and cffi simple examples

  # luajit
  local ffi =3D require("ffi")
  ffi.cdef[[
  int printf(const char *fmt, ...);
  ]]

  # python cffi
  from cffi import FFI
  ffi =3D FFI()
  ffi.cdef("""
        int printf(const char *fmt, ...);
  """)

I had a gut feeling that the extra complexity of implementing/maintaining C=
 declaration parsing code may not be worth it. Given the types of setup que=
stions on this list, and the setup info on the FFI wiki pages, what's your =
XNI perspective?
