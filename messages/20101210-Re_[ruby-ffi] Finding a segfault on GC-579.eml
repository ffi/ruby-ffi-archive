Ah, I think this may well be it! The minimal test runs and, even
better, so does the entire unit test suite! Cheers!

I wrote up a quick patch to store the values from the error handler
methods in Thread.current and everything seems to be working as
expected including multithreading which is tremendous.

I take it that garbage collection was trying to clean up some things
it shouldn't and that was wreaking havoc, yeah? I'd like to step
through this in gdb when I get a chance now that I know what to look
for to try and understand what's happening in more detail, but for now
I'm ecstatic that things appear to be working. This was the last major
(known) issue in the library and I think a beta release is due for
some testing.

Cheers again, and thanks!
