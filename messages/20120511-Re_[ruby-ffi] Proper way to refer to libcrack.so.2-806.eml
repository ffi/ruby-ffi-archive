Although I think those are both useful suggestions, like all the other 
feature suggestions I've been getting, I've been pushing back and 
recommending they be done in a third-party gem.  That way, the new features 
can be used on e.g. JRuby without the lag of waiting until JRuby's FFI 
implements the new feature (installing the ffi gem on jruby does not update 
the ffi implementation, since it is internal to JRuby).

ffi_lib is implemented in ruby, so implementing an alternative version of 
it won't be that hard, should work across all implementations, and making 
use of it in a gem can be as easy as:

require 'ffi-xtra'

module FooLib
  extend FFI::Xtra::Library

  ffi_lib 'crack', '>= 2' # loads "libcrack.so.2"

  ... # attach_function, etc
end

I'm happy for source for such a gem to be hosted under the ffi github org, 
and make it the 'official' extra-features-that-people-want gem we can throw 
all this type of stuff into it.
