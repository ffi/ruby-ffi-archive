We've had a couple of threads about this in the last 6 months, and although
I think FFI developers are in favor of a unifying / standard test suite,
nobody has had the time or the will to be point-man for the project.

So: thanks for volunteering?

The API is pretty stable at this point, I think -- at least between
CRuby/MRI and JRuby, which have recently been the biggest supporters of FFI.

I'm willing to help unify and standardize, if someone is willing to
coordinate and pester all the people who need to be pestered.
