Actually, now that I checked, get_double is there (it seems to call
get_float64). I just thought that there would be a read_double method
(which seemed to be the public API, as opposed to get_* methods).

And what about read/get_size_t? That really seems to be undefined
here.

By the way, I have RubyFFI 0.5.4 (latests from rubygems) and Ruby 1.9.

Thank you
