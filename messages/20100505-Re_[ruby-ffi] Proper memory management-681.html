<br>Relying on the MRI GC is no problem, just that I would need this to be

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm in the process of developing a Ruby binding to the GSL numerical
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library using FFI. Recently I stumbled upon a problematic issue
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regarding memory management and finalizers.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the GSL library allows creation and destruction of instances
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like this:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gsl_vector* ptr = gsl_alloc_vector(size_t n);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gsl_free_vector(ptr);
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in Ruby I do something like this:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class Vector
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def initialize(n)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @ptr = GSLng.backend.gsl_alloc_vector(n)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vector.define_finalizer(self, @ptr)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def Vector.define_finalizer(self, ptr)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ObjectSpace.define_finalizer(self, lambda {<code class="moz-txt-verticalline"><span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span>id<span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span></code>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GSLng.backend.gsl_free_vector(ptr)})
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that if later I instatiante a Vector inside a loop,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10000.times do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vector.new(3)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This obviously eats a lot of memory until GC runs. Now, if I do:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10000.times do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vector.new(3)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GC.start
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the memory that the Vector instances themselves occupy is freed but
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the finalizer is not called (it is later called at program end),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore all of the memory allocated through gsl_alloc_vector() is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sitting there until program ends.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that Ruby doesn't guarantee that finalizers are called in any
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particular moment (even after GC.start, which I thought would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffice). So what I'm asking probably is not really related to FFI
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself, but I wanted to ask here since I imagined this would be a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; common pattern among FFI users. The question is then: is there a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better way to manage this type of memory? I obviously cant use the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transaction-like pattern (like File.open) since for a Vector that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't make sense. It would be ideal to make the gsl_vector_free
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call when the actual Vector class is free'd. Maybe I need to go to a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lower level for this and use the C api to register this call in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "free" function for this class, but that would be overkill since I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted to avoid using C altogether.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you!
